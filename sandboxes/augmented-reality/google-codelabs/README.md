# Google Codelab

**N.B. This work is currently [Blocked] as we cannot get past step 2.**

We are following the tutorial here: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/ar-with-webxr/

## Prerequisites:
- [Chrome Canary](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/chrome-canary-unstable/chrome-canary-unstable-72-0-3626-0-release/chrome-canary-unstable-72-0-3626-0-android-apk-download/) [versions 70-72] installed on your phone
- An android phone on the [list of supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices)
- [AR Core](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en_GB) installed on the phone

## Steps
1. Enable the flags @ `chrome://flags` in chrome on the mobile phone for `#webxr` & `#webxr-hit-test` and hit `RELAUNCH NOW`
2. Open https://googlecodelabs.github.io/ar-with-webxr/work/ on the mobile device to confirm the flags have been set up
	_currently on an honor 8x this causes chrome canary to crash, and on an samsung s7 edge this display an `unsupported` warning_
