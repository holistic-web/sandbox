# Web XR
Web XR is the new module of javascript coming to all browsers very soon. In this project we will look at the tutorial here: https://webxrtutorials.com/an-intro-to-webxr/

**N.B. It's important to ensure any web-xr flags are set to default in order for A-Frame to work.**

## Running the packages
1. run `npm install` on this folder to install dependencies
2. run `npm start` on this folder to run the webserver
3. navigate to the port shown in the terminal followed by the folder name. i.e. `localhost:5000/tutorial-1`
4. to view on a mobile, install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and then run the equivalent of `ngrok http 5000` for the port shown above. This will provide a link that will work on mobile
